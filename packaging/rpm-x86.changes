- Added and updated OBS-Accelerator-0.1.tar.bz2

* Sun Apr 24 08:02:35 UTC 2011 - Jan-Simon MÃ¶ller <jsmoeller@linuxfoundation.org> - 1.0
- Add baselibs.conf to src.rpm

* Fri Jan 21 08:13:00 UTC 2011 Carsten Munk <carsten@maemo.org> - 1.0
- Change ln -s to cp, as 'build' script does a test -x rpmsign from outside the
  chroot and this obviously doesn't evaluate correctly. This fixes
  build log artifacts such as: 
  warning: .init_b_cache/kernel-headers.rpm: Header V3 DSA/SHA1 Signature, 
  key ID 79fc1f8a: NOKEY  
- Remove verbose output of scripts

* Mon Jan  3 21:03:00 UTC 2011 Carsten Munk <carsten@maemo.org> - 1.0
